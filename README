This project contains some helpful scripts that I use in daily development.
Feel comfortable to fork, improve, add new scripts or features, and pull it back.

To Install it in your Mac or Linux, just execute the following commands:
git clone git://github.com/andrefaria/good-scripts.git;

cd good-scripts/bin;
chmod +x *;
./add-this-folder-to-path;

Open a new terminal, and all the commands will be available for you to use!
