## Good scripts

This project contains some helpful scripts that we use in daily development at Bluesoft.
Feel comfortable to fork, improve, add new scripts or features, and pull it back.

To install it in your Mac or Linux machine, just execute the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/bluesoft/good-scripts.git;
    cd good-scripts/bin;
    ./add-this-folder-to-path;

Open a new terminal, and all the commands will be available for you to use!

Note: if it doesn't work, try running: `chmod +x *;`
